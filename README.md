# LTFS-DataScience-Finhack
L&T Financial Services held a competition on [AnalyticsVidhya.](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/ltfs-datascience-finhack-an-online-hackathon/ "Competition Page")

This is my solution to the competition. I have used LightGBM and tried to tune it with Bayesian Optimizers but did not able to improve the score further.

I stood 488 on Private Laderboard.

**Enjoy The Life Feel The Music.**
